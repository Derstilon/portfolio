# Mini Portfolio

This project is a mini portfolio that shows some of my projects and skills.

Project was created using advanced CSS techniques, such as flexbox, grid, transitions, gradients, etc.

Styles have been separated into different files for better organization and readability. I also tired to be as unobtrusive as possible with the styles, so that specific files can be easily removed or added without breaking the whole project. (Except for the main.css and pamphlet.css files, which are the main stylesheets for the project.)
